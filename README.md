# Prophet Time Series Rolling Forecast Model: Maverik
**Capstone Final MSBA - 2023**

[Github Repo:](https://github.com/bvasherchan/ProphetTimeSeriesModel)

This repository is my group's complete implementation for MSBA Capstone Final Project.

In this project we used ```Prophet``` to create a rolling window forecast model that produces daily predictions for a given horizon period (365 days). This model takes into account new sales data, and re-trains the model to produce a more accurate prediction every day.

Below are the materials from this course.

# Random Forest and Naive Bayes Text Classification Model for Ecommerce products
**NLP - MSBA Project**

[Github Repo:](https://github.com/bvasherchan/NLP)

This repository is my complete implementation for MSBA Text Analytics Class Project.

In this project I used ```Random Forest and Naive Bayes Text Classification models``` to accurately classify a product into one the existing labels based on the product description. I will test out two models in this project - Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest.
